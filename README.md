**Problem Statement:**
"How might we educate time poor SMBs to be cyber secure?"
 



**Solution:**
	VicysaverTool- A network anomaly detector for the digital safety of SMBs. The VicysaverTool is a Machine Learning powered API that can be integrated with the customer’s infrastructure using cloud. This API performs inference on the incoming network traffic data from the client’s website and alerts the client back with a response if a suspicious activity gets detected. 




**Features:**

   - Captures associations between online resources (account IDs/hostnames and IPv4 addresses
   - Assign scores based on compatibility between hostnames and IP addresses
   - Sends an auto alert in the form of an e-mail to the client with the details of the detected abnormal activity
   - Supports interactive dashboards and visualizations of the predicted data hosted in a web portal.


**Installation Steps**


- Watch the demo video and ppt (Refer Case Study @ https://www.rmit.edu.au/for-business/activator/partnerships/cloud-innovation-centre) to understand the functionality of the application.
- Place 'generate_data.py' and 'Final_notebook_TeamF5.ipynb' files in the same folder.
- In the 'Final_notebook_TeamF5.ipynb' notebook restart and run all cells. 
- Test Data File folder contains the csv files that will have to be placed in the s3 bucket and link it to the Python notebook.
